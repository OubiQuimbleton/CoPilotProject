# CoPilotProject
The functional CoPilot project for my IST 440 course

In order to get this web application to run on your local host, you will need to follow a couple of steps:
1. Download Node.js using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download
   This project requires a Node.js package to run on your localhost. There are other ways to set this up, but Node.js is the simplest one I found.
2. Run this command in powershell: npm install http-server -g
3. Run the command "http-server" at the location of the index.html file. This will host the webpage on your localhost.
4. Open a web browser and type in "localhost:8080" in the address bar.
5. Congratulations, you can now run the CoPilot Web Application!
